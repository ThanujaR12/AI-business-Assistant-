When putting on the shorts, it feels like the liner is another pair of underwear, so when it gets up to your actual underwear, it makes it ride up, and you have to adjust for it and makes everything kind of feel bunched up. Then there's the pockets, normally shorts have the pickets slightly in front of you, around the 1/2 o'clock and the 10/11 o'clock area, that would feel ergonomic, and the pocket it angled  forward do your hand can slide in easily. However, these feel like they put right on the 9 and 3 oclock, and the pockets go straight in, meaning the pocket has a chance to go back towards the butt, and I find it hard to fit anything in them without them falling out.

I wouldn't recommend these socks if your feet sweat a lot. If your feet get hot like mine and you prefer to wear socks most of the time, these should be ok.  They are breathable and at first I hated them.  I've had them on a little while now and think they should be ok around the house, or in shoes where you would want thinner socks.  They will not provide cushioning anywhere on the foot so if you are looking for a nice thick sock on the bottom these are not for you.  They do have the arch elastic which I prefer, and a nice thickness around the ankle elastic.  They look nice, but like I said very thin, I'm back and forth between and 3 and 4 star rating just because I'm not sure how long they will hold up, and because they are advertised as lightweight. If they weren't I would be between a 2 and 3 star rating.  First impression is the socks are very thin, like the ones my mom used to buy at the dollar store thinking she was getting a great deal and they were junk in a month, lol.  Hope they last a year I bought 2-6 packs.  I found some socks I loved years ago that lasted like 3 years no issues, but now I can't find anything I like to replace them with. Maybe these will work out, WILL HAVE TO WEAR 2 PAIRS IN THE WINTER, LOL.  Please see pics, hope this is helpful.

After washing it and drying it in the dryer, it came out fluffy and not stiff at all. I have below shoulder length hair and a lot of it. I used this to dry my hair and it was very absorbent. First I pat it all over my head to get most of the water out. Then I hang my head upside down and start at my neck, laying the towel over my hair. I flip it up and twist the towel near my forehead. It held up well for this task. I was able to walk around my house, getting dressed, etc for 1/2 hour without it dripping water or falling off. This is the key test for me and towels.

I also wanted it to hang a bit lower in the front and back.  1x or extra large in brown. Fit great, soft material. I am 5'3 175 lb. Wore it with a long brass necklace the first time I wore it, it scraped across the shirt and caused some snagging.    Fits true to size. I am 5’6” and 150 lbs. and the Medium was fine. Not too clingy with a little swing on the bottom.   It is very much tunic length. My jean shorts are only really visible from profile or when sitting down, but the color is good, fabric is soft, and I think it flattering overall.   The material is soft and very comfortable. Well made, fits true to size and looks very nice on.

The 650s I  still have, still use, and they are as nice as the day I bouhgt them.  The 300s (thinner) were wearing out some and forner roommate stole them.  I now need to downsize to twin sz and found these on Walmart website.  I always wash materials before using and didnt want to wash whole set just in case, why?  package said Egyptian\"" cotton, tag on sheets said \""Supima\""  cotton.  Having bought and returned Egyptian cotton sheets, I know they are not the same, tho some will argue they are.  I washed 2 pillow cases with the sheets just took off my bed, and out of the dryer, my sheets had barely a crease and were soft and cool on the skin.  These 2 cases were oddly rough on the surface and I thought, what the H?  Kept rubbing them on my face and hands over their surface, and they were very different ... rough ... not gonna put my head/face on these and try to sleep!  When I took them out of package, they were soft and smooth, but out of the wash were very rough texture, somewhat wrinkled (tho not too badly).  Why the big difference? I even went back to the package and the sheets were smooth and soft, unwashed.  I cannot sleep on these, and they have to he washed.  So I returned them to Walmart on store 7/8/24 and have yet to receive a refund from this Walmart \""Marketplace\"" seller.  Walmart does not refund you, imthe item is sent back to seller to decide if they will refund.  These were made in India and shipped thru Dubai, which I did not know until got the customs page with the package. Have nothing against any product made in India.  Today, I pick up my phone and log onto my Walmart acct to check on this refund, and oh my g, right front and center is this review about how soft these sheets are, giving 5 stars.  Why am I getting this?  Now I know not all reviews are legit!  Youbknow, you always wonder how much you can trust the reviews, I aboutbhalf believe them and never believe the lazies who only leave thumbs up or down, take time to leave truthful, accurate reviews!  This was my experience, I am not a thief that I should lie  These are not the supuma cotton sheets I have loved and exclusively used for YEARS.  Living in scorpion territory here in Arizona, I cannot use the queen flat sheet on my now single size bed as they drag on the floor, and scorpions love to crawl up.  So I neen new sheets.  Supima cotton has either changed over the years since I last purchased, or in India these are considered supima, but not the supima I am looking for.

And the humidity ? Ack. Although I like the looks and cut of this shirt, it seems to run larger than the 3XL I had ordered. And...the material is very, very heavy; on top of which, I ordered it in black. I'm thinking that it will be best served to wear it open, over a contrasting tee shirt...and in cooler weather. In October that ought to be fine; in May, I'm guessing it would be unbearable. Of importance--also--is whether this shirt will retain its color, shape, and size after several launderings. I will NOT be happy if I end up with 'doll clothes' that have to be ironed. No.No.No. If 'lift-off' is a go, I'll probably buy several other shirts like it. Regards to all.

There are six buttons at one end of the covet to close it up. The button holes were too short/small and I had a very hard time buttoning the buttons. I think it would be a lot nicer if there was a zipper in place of buttons. A zipper would also have a nicer appearance having the bottom closed up verses opened spaces in between the six buttons.\r\n\r\nI would say the length isn't what I would consider extra long. I adjusted the comforter to hang over the side away from the wall and at the end of the bed to cover the box spring. I don't have a bed skirt.

It comes with 500GB NVME SSD. 8Gb of DRR5, if you're gonna run higher end games or stuff of the sorts, I recommend buying another 8GB of DDR5 to increase the performance even more. You can upgrade the RAM up to 16GB of DDR5 and you can upgrade your storage but you'll have to use software to pass your current drive to your new one as there is no second SSD spot.

Spot Cleaning: For minor stains, use a damp cloth with a mild soap solution. Gently blot the stain and avoid excessive rubbing, which can damage the mesh fabric. Deep Cleaning: Mesh Upholstery: Mix a small amount of mild detergent with warm water. Dip a clean cloth into the solution and wring out excess water. Wipe the mesh upholstery gently, then rinse with a damp cloth and let it air dry completely. Metal Frame: Wipe the metal base and frame with a damp cloth and mild detergent. Dry thoroughly with a soft cloth to prevent water spots and rust. Care: Avoid Direct Sunlight: Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can cause fading and damage to the mesh fabric. Place the chair in a shaded area or use window coverings to protect it from UV rays. Temperature and Humidity: Keep the chair in a well-ventilated area with moderate temperature and humidity levels to prevent any damage to the material. Maintenance: Check for Loose Parts: Regularly inspect the chair for any loose screws or parts. Tighten any loose components to ensure the chair remains stable and secure. Caster Wheels: Clean the caster wheels periodically to remove any dirt or debris that may hinder smooth movement. Use a vacuum or a brush to clean the wheels thoroughly. Avoid Harsh Chemicals: Do not use abrasive cleaners, bleach, or harsh chemicals on the chair as they can damage the mesh fabric and metal parts.

That shows how much I've actually liked it. I was a bit skeptical as I've jumped from drugstore powder foundation in my teens to high end foundation as an adult and have not used drug store foundationsince teenage years. I have been pleasantly surprised. \n\nI love that the foundation goes on as a light matte finish. All my makeup goes on very well. Mostly I love that once I have foundation on it feels so light on my skin that it doesn't feel like I have foundation on. Lastly, I love that I do not get dry patches around my mouth/face as I normally get with my high end foundation which I have really loved. My face is combination although Oily I do happen to have dry patches in certain areas. Has SPF15, vitamin E, is extremely affordable, goes on beautifully. The color is a perfect match. \n\nMy don't likes... I do not like that this makeup seems to rub off quite easily. I do have a bad tendency to wipe my face a lot with my hands because I can feel my face getting Oily. When I use my phone I can see transfer of makeup and when dabbing with a napkin. My face does tends to get shiny due to oil but not terrible with this foundation. \n\nHonestly, I think the trade off of having Oily dewy skin vs patches due to mattifying too much...honestly I prefer it that way. \n\nI've really grown to like this foundation and can see myself buying this for everyday wear."",""title"":""Combination skin foundation""},{""name"":""ver███das███"",""rating"":5,""review"":""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This stayed put in hot, humid, summer heat. Most of the time-- my skin breaks down foundations, even those that say they are \""long lasting.\"" But this foundation really was. It didn't budge until I removed it. And it was a super long day too, almost 24 hrs at the longest period of wear. I needed 2 washes, one of them with noxzema in order to remove all of it. Another thing I will say-- it works best if you just use your fingertips to blend it into your skin. It didnt look as good when I used a beauty blender to apply the foundation. It also didnt last as long either. For this foundation-- just using your fingers to blend seems best. The color payoff was really good. This foundation is pigmented and has good coverage in my opinion. It also does not dry too quickly-- this way you have enough time to blend the foundation into your skin. In addition-- it sets well with any powder you have on hand. I just used a compact because we were traveling. And it worked fantastic!! It also DID NOT leave me shiny or anything like that. I also found out later that this is a foundation that many women in Southern Arizona favor--- because it can stand up to the very hot heat of the AZ desert. I found out that 2 of my cousins use it, and I had always wondered what foundation they used that didn't just straight up melt off their faces. Well-- it is Revlon Colorstay Foundation. \nThe absolute best part was that this foundation didn't break me out. That was fantastic to find out. I hate using a new foundation and finding out that it breaks me out. None of that from Revlon Colorstay!!! It works great and doesn't break me out at all. This foundation is definitely a keeper and I will be using it from now on. In addition--- there is a good selection of shades for POC who may have dark skin tones.

I also wanted it to hang a bit lower in the front and back.  1x or extra large in brown. Fit great, soft material. I am 5'3 175 lb. Wore it with a long brass necklace the first time I wore it, it scraped across the shirt and caused some snagging.    Fits true to size. I am 5’6” and 150 lbs. and the Medium was fine. Not too clingy with a little swing on the bottom.   It is very much tunic length. My jean shorts are only really visible from profile or when sitting down, but the color is good, fabric is soft, and I think it flattering overall.   The material is soft and very comfortable.

The lid holders are nice, though a little difficult to get in the first time.\r\n\r\nI live the idea of this instead of flame burners, as long as you have an outlet close to table or counter where you willbuse.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I love it and cant wait to use at next party. I live alone so I couldn't justify getting it dirty for just myself.\r\n\r\nI would recommend this appliance."",""title"":""Will come in handy at holiday parties""},{""name"":""DC"",""rating"":5,""review"":""I really love this Triple Slow Cooker a lot. I first used it for our niece's birthday party get together. I used it to serve hot dogs and chili. Since the ceramic crocks are oval shaped they are the perfect size to fit bun length franks. I had beef franks heating in one crock, hot dog chili in the middle crock and turkey franks in the last crock. Each warmer has a wire rack to hold the lid up and out of the way while you get your food. The lid hangs on the rack with the edge just over the lip of the crock pot so steam or any drippings from the lid drain right back into the crock. Genius! No mess on the countertop from setting the lid on it. The first time I used it was on the party day and as the unit started to heat up it smelled up the whole kitchen with a melting plastic like odor. I guess because it was brand new. But after awhile, the food smell took over and all was good. You may want to use it prior to event day to avoid that first use smell. This would be perfect for small get togethers or office pot luck events and such.

It's a love affair that began over 35 years ago, and to this day, he continues to sport the same style, model, size, and color with unwavering devotion. These shoes have become more than just footwear; they are a part of his identity, a symbol of reliability, comfort, and enduring style.\n\nThe Reebok Classic Leather shoes are not just your average pair of sneakers; they are vintage-inspired footwear designed to stand the test of time. Crafted with premium leather and adorned with soft suede overlays, they exude a classic yet contemporary charm that never goes out of fashion. The textured look of the materials adds depth and character to the shoes, while also enhancing their durability and longevity.\n\nOne of the standout features of these Reebok shoes is their soft terry lining, which provides a luxurious feel and ensures unparalleled comfort with every step. Whether he's running errands, taking a leisurely stroll, or simply relaxing at home, my dad swears by the unmatched coziness and support offered by his trusty Classic Leather sneakers. They effortlessly adapt to his feet, providing a snug fit that feels like a second skin.\n\nWhat truly sets these shoes apart is their versatility. Unlike other sneakers that are reserved for specific occasions or activities, the Reebok Classic Leather shoes are designed to be worn anywhere and everywhere. From casual outings to more formal events, they seamlessly transition from day to night, making them the ultimate wardrobe staple for my dad.\n\nAnother noteworthy aspect of these shoes is their low-maintenance nature. While other sneakers may require frequent spot-cleaning or special care, the Reebok Classic Leather shoes are built to withstand the rigors of everyday wear. Their durable construction and high-quality materials ensure that they only get better with age, developing a unique patina and character that reflects my dad's journey over the years.\n\nIn conclusion, my father's unwavering love for his Reebok Classic Leather shoes is a testament to their exceptional craftsmanship, timeless design, and unmatched comfort. After 35 years of faithful companionship, these sneakers have become more than just footwear; they are cherished memories of countless adventures and milestones. With their soft terry lining, vintage-inspired style, and durable construction, it's no wonder my dad continues to swear by his beloved Reebok shoes year after year."",""title"":""My Dad has been wearing these shoes for over 3 decades""},{""name"":""Dou███29"",""rating"":5,""review"":""Slippers have gone from the lazy day wear to what people where every day including when they are out and about.

This is a great shirt, very much worth the sale price, not sure if I would pay more though. But I do really love these!

That said, I wear a size 6 in Old Navy jeans, and it took going all the way up to size XL to achieve the perfect look (demonstrating the model's representation of the loose, long fit), so bear in mind that you will probably need to size up SEVERAL times to achieve the style shown. What I really love about these shirts, is that they can be put through both the washer and dryer with ZERO shrinkage, and it is very easy to keep them soft and wrinkle-free, the colors are BEAUTIFUL, and imho look even better in person than online. I would absolutely recommend these, but only if you can catch them on sale. They are easy-care, so very soft and comfortable, beautiful, bright fade-free colors with just a touch of stretch, but a teensy bit overpriced if you don't catch them on sale. I imagine it would be a pretty close fit if I ordered my regular size, so if you like them loose and long, then I'd definitely recommend sizing up, but all in all these are a great, soft, all-season (Florida) find, and I'm so happy to have found them!"",""title"":""Great find, size up for the fit shown""},{""name"":""Lisa"",""rating"":5,""review"":""True to size fitting without being to snugged, so if you like it fitted with a little extra breathing room this is for you."",""title"":""Nice too""},{""name"":""Tanya"",""rating"":5,""review"":""Great material fits great""},{""name"":""Suz███e"",""rating"":5,""review"":""I like the color and fit of this long sleeve t-shirt.

If you look at the picture I included the cover is not very wrinkle free.\r\n\r\nI thought the color was going to be more of a tan shade/tone. It depends on the lighting I see a dark tan/green tone. It's hard to say exactly what color the cover is. The cover is machine washable in warm water and tumble dry.\r\n\r\nThe duvet cover is wide and long enough to cover a comforter. There are six buttons at one end of the covet to close it up. The button holes were too short/small and I had a very hard time buttoning the buttons. I think it would be a lot nicer if there was a zipper in place of buttons. A zipper would also have a nicer appearance having the bottom closed up verses opened spaces in between the six buttons.\r\n\r\nI would say the length isn't what I would consider extra long. I adjusted the comforter to hang over the side away from the wall and at the end of the bed to cover the box spring. I don't have a bed skirt.

These front door mats efficiently scrape mud, grit, and dirt, trapping them within patterned grooves to prevent tracking them indoors. This outdoor mat is constructed with heavy-duty 2KG/? durable rubber backing and an A-grade 650g/? polypropylene surface, which is much thicker and heavier than other normal TPE or TPR backing entrance mats. This ensures the door mat remains in place on various floor types, such as marble, concrete, and wood, without shifting or skidding, even on windy days. The A-Class absorbent polypropylene surface can quickly absorb water and rain, making it a perfect indoor outdoor doormat for keeping your home tidy and pristine. The specialized crosshatch pattern design is practical and stylish, making your home?s entrance stand out while serving to facilitate the scraping process as individuals wipe their feet on the outdoor mat. Rolling package rubber entry mat grips the floor securely and uniformly without warping corners or creases. These low-profile door rugs for inside and outside can be widely used, such as outdoor mats for front door and back door, garage door rugs, porch rugs, welcome mats, and shoe mats. They can withstand all weather and seasonal changes, regardless of whether it is rainy, windy, or snowy winter. The waterproof rubber back ensures that water won?t seep underneath and cause rotting. For regular cleaning, simply sweep, vacuum, or shake off. For deeper cleaning, rinse the door mats outdoors with a garden hose, and hang them outside; these floor mats will quickly dry fully with air.

ALL the women, no matter if they had children or not, got stuck with a bigger tummy. Eden was my grandmother’s maiden name. Now you know what an “Eden tummy” is.

A simple zipper closure makes it easy to slip your duvet in and out, and corner ties prevent your insert from bunching up while you sleep.

Easy Care: Simply toss the duvet cover in the washing machine. Wash it in cold water with similar colors. Tumble dry on low and remove from the dryer promptly to prevent wrinkling.

The material attracts every piece of lint, dust, hair, anything I came in contact with, so I definitely don't recommend if you have pets! The material also wrinkles very easily. After you wash them, they shrink a bit. The drawstrings are thick, and also shrink, causing them to coil in a weird way. The ONLY thing I liked about these are the pockets. I am 5'4\"", length is good, but when you bend over, your buttcrack pops out. I was dreading squatting because i was afraid they would split.  These scrubs are just garbage. I gave 2 sets to a coworker that usually wears medium. She agrees with everything I complained to her about. I also have large breasts, another coworker looked at my back and said the bottom of the shirt puffs out, or pouches, at the lower back because my breasts pull it tight on top. I didn't notice that myself. I thought the top fit okay, other than it doesn't stretch. But apparently it looked funny back there.

I tried the pink Treat Love & Color, and I like that it is very subtle and sheer for a more natural look.  Several days ago I put on 2 coats, and yesterday I worked as a volunteer at a horse rescue ranch.  I did NOT wear gloves.

This squishy slice of heaven arrived vacuum-packed in a surprisingly tiny box that my skeptical mother insisted could never unfold into a real bed. But after freeing this foam frankenstein from its plastic prison, it rapidly reinflated into a delightful dream cloud. \n\nLike a clingy partner, the memory foam conforms perfectly to my shape, cradling my side-sleeping form in a gentle embrace. I now snooze peacefully through the night in one position instead of flopping around in an endless quest for comfort. My dog is equally smitten, stealing naps in the corner of my new foam friend. \n\nMornings are now painless, my back blissfully free of the usual aches. The mattress sleeps cool and fresh, unlike my sweltering old foam furnace. I eagerly anticipate bedtime, when I can reunite with my beloved mattress. We're a perfect match - it's supportive where I need it, cushy where I want it. I can't imagine ever parting with this bed. Unlike fickle human companions, my Zinus mattress will never let me down.

The mattress is incredibly cozy, providing a perfect balance of firmness and softness that ensures a comfortable night's sleep. \r\n\r\nOne standout feature is its cooling properties. I tend to get warm at night, but this mattress keeps me comfortably cool, preventing any overheating. The infusion of green tea not only helps to maintain freshness but also offers a pleasant, subtle aroma that adds to the relaxing sleep environment.\r\n\r\nOverall, the Zinus Green Tea Mattress is a fantastic investment.

My friend had a expensive memory foam mattress in his house and I tried it before and didn't like it.

After you wash them, they shrink a bit. The drawstrings are thick, and also shrink, causing them to coil in a weird way. The ONLY thing I liked about these are the pockets. I am 5'4\"", length is good, but when you bend over, your buttcrack pops out. I was dreading squatting because i was afraid they would split.  These scrubs are just garbage. I gave 2 sets to a coworker that usually wears medium. She agrees with everything I complained to her about. I also have large breasts, another coworker looked at my back and said the bottom of the shirt puffs out, or pouches, at the lower back because my breasts pull it tight on top. I didn't notice that myself. I thought the top fit okay, other than it doesn't stretch. But apparently it looked funny back there.

If you can't turn it off, set it to the highest position possible. Finally, place the vacuum on the rug carefully.

I've only ever worn bras with an underwire, so wireless is a \""how?\"" to me. But I was very impressed with the Playtex 18 Hour Ultimate Lift & Support Wireless Bra. The cups hold and shape well and there are reinforced seams on the side that help the girls stay facing forward and not slipping out. Let me be the first to say, it felt weird not having an underwire....but dang it was so comfortable too!

Model 4745 wirefree.  Stiff and stretchy combo all in one goodness. The fabric under the ‘girls' is unvarying without an elastic give providing good soft support without hard wires. Elastic stretchy material then continues on the left and right underarm areas and onto the backside to a hook and loop closure. I received as a free product for an honest opinion and here are my observations.\n \nPros: nice black color and cute leopard like pattern design in fabric. Stitched lines on cup bottoms provide uplifting support which is nice to keep everything in place. Wide stretch panels on the sides to keep the flab in check from sides to back. Appears to be well sewn and constructed to last a long time making it a good investment for the bra drawer. \n\nCons: the elastic strap section parts are a little short as there is limited distance to change shoulder length. The cushioning shoulder strap part did not sit comfortable across the top of my shoulder and I could feel the stitch lines where the fabric is sewn to the elastic shoulder strap. These are just my observations on how this bra fit my body. I prefer a soft shoulder padding to fit up and over the shoulder top then a longer elastic piece to adjust. Over a break in period the fabric should become more soft and stretching just right.\n   \nDetails to know: The material is nylon and spandex so it is a lightweight, breathable and stretchy.  The bra should be hand washed in cold water and line dried to achieve maximum material life. The non-stretchy part under the cups measures about fourteen inches across the front. Shoulder strap length is seven inches non stretch fabric connected to an elastic piece about eight inches stretched out. Shoulder strap fully stretched from cup top to backside is about fifteen inches fully extended to backside. Black hook and loop closure is three inches wide with hooks spaced at three quarters of an inch on center. Three lines of loops provide varying adjustment lengths for comfort around bust. Overall, a nice supportive bra and would purchase and recommend. Give the bra some break in time to stretch and match the body for full comfort."",""title"":""Snazzy black number 4745""},{""name"":""Jea███e"",""rating"":5,""review"":""I always order the same bra, but I recently lost 55 pounds.

SHAG RUG CARE INSTRUCTION - Spray extraction, along with use of a wool-approved product, can be used to clean shag rugs. Shedding is normal for shag products and decreases over time. Do not pull yarn out, as this may result in damage to the rug. Canister vacuums without a beater bar are most effective in cleaning shag rugs. Vacuums with beater bars and/or brushes, or those set too low, may abrade the face of the rug.

MADE IN Turkey - Indulge in luxury with our Turkish area rug. Crafted with high-quality materials, this rug is not only durable but also adds a touch of sophistication to any room. Bring the rich history and elegance of Turkey into your home with this exclusive piece.   HOW TO VACUUM YOUR RUG - To vacuum your rug, use a canister vacuum without a beater bar a broom, or a manual sweeper. Upright vacuums with high suction power can pull threads from the rug's back and cause ""sprouts."" Use a handheld attachment if possible, or turn off the beater bar as it can pull fibers from the face of the rug and cause the rug to fuzz. If you can't turn it off, set it to the highest position possible. Finally, place the vacuum on the rug carefully.

SHAG RUG CARE INSTRUCTION - Spray extraction, along with use of a wool-approved product, can be used to clean shag rugs. Shedding is normal for shag products and decreases over time. Do not pull yarn out, as this may result in damage to the rug. Canister vacuums without a beater bar are most effective in cleaning shag rugs. Vacuums with beater bars and/or brushes, or those set too low, may abrade the face of the rug.

MADE IN Turkey - Indulge in luxury with our Turkish area rug. Crafted with high-quality materials, this rug is not only durable but also adds a touch of sophistication to any room. Bring the rich history and elegance of Turkey into your home with this exclusive piece.   HOW TO VACUUM YOUR RUG - To vacuum your rug, use a canister vacuum without a beater bar a broom, or a manual sweeper. Upright vacuums with high suction power can pull threads from the rug's back and cause ""sprouts."" Use a handheld attachment if possible, or turn off the beater bar as it can pull fibers from the face of the rug and cause the rug to fuzz. If you can't turn it off, set it to the highest position possible. Finally, place the vacuum on the rug carefully.

So, this two-piece sofa coverup seemed to be the answer to the above challenges. It arrived in perfect condition, all wrapped up in a heavy-duty clear carry bag. The directions are in the carry case and very easy to follow; it is in two pieces: the base and the cushions cover. The challenge of putting it on the sofa, is all the stretching to make it fit correctly on the three-cushion sofa. The outer cloth material was surprisingly very soft and has a light corduroy ridge pattern design. The granddaughters and dog gave their thumbs and paws up for snuggling on it. I really like the soft Dove Gray color, as it blended well with the other room furniture; almost a neutral color. While in use, the cover does move around a bit, but was fairly easy to pull back into a sharper and neater appearance. The material is a bit thin, so time will tell on how long it will keep looking as great as it is. I requested the “Sofa” size and it fit a normal three-cushion size sofa, with a little to spare. It is made in China. I believe the material mix is 85% polyester and 15% spandex. I machine washed it twice in cold water and on delicate load; then dried it on low and took it out at the end of the drying cycle, so as to not create wrinkles – do not iron. I gave it a four star, as it did not come with any type of clip and stretch type of adjustments.

Thank you.""},{""name"":null,""rating"":5,""review"":""I ordered this long sleeved tee in my regular size (2X).  I'm 5'7”, 220 lbs. approx. as my weight fluctuates.  When it arrived, it didn't look exciting on a hanger and appeared small, but when I tried it on I was impressed.  The fit is perfect, but not so close fitting I am afraid to wash it (haven't yet).   The color was called Dusty Pink, I think.  It's a light shade that is neutral, like a very light skin tone.  It's so neutral I would not hesitate to wear it under dresses in Winter, and it would go with many tops and bottoms.  I'm used to manufacturers using the terms “dusty” or “ash” to mean that there is a gray undertone. With these, it just means it is a more muted shade, not bright, which is what I was looking for because the exact color to match the tan in my new wide-leg leggings is sold out.  The colors with actual gray tones seem to have the word “gray” in the color name.  I don't like to wear tunics with wide-leg leggings or jeans because then I look big all over.  This shirt is EXACTLY what I wanted.  It's not tunic length or shape if you're plus size and busty like me…it's like a long sleeve t-shirt with extra material strategically placed in the belly, waist, and hip area that minimizes the belly, hips, and thighs.  I am a pear shape (but the lower part of the pear starts with a large natural waist).  It covers my bellly, fly, and upper thighs.  This shirt is the opposite of boxy, and doesn't scream “plus size” bell or tunic shirt.  On me, it shows my narrow shoulders and feminine curves in the chest and high waist while still being 9 to 5 modest.  Then it gently slopes out at the hips and thighs.  A little thicker material would be warmer but the flexibility and lightweight material makes it fall in a way that shows all the right curves and covers those I'd rather not display.  I'm glad I chose this over a cheaper thick tee with wide wrist holes that was on sale.  I cannot say enough about the fit!  The sleeves ARE a little long, which tells me it would fit broader shoulders too (mine are very narrow).  They are roomy enough for comfort and narrow at the wrist, so I don't have to push them up all day!  I would rather have this well-fitting shirt layer over it for warmth.  It will work as a stands-alone shirt in Summer. It's not too casual to dress it up, not too dressy for everyday use.  I will definitely buy more.  I instantly regretted buying 2 more in 3X (a size up) but I don't know if they shrink so I will wash the 2X and see how it does before returning the 3X for my regular size.  It might be nice to wear in different sizes.  It fits shorter in plus than on the smaller models online.  If you click on different colors, some show a plus size model and they fit just like that.  I ordered up right after placing my first order because I saw that my waist is an inch  bigger than the size chart.  Don't worry if your waist measurement is at the lower end of the next size range…it's generously cut in the middle and lower body."",""title"":""Beautiful fit for Plus Size!

The 3XL fully covers my 44E chest, my 9 month pregnant belly and my *cough* 250lbs *cough* no problem. They are ever so slightly snug  2. I usually wear a size XL in shirts and after reading reviews I went ahead and ordered the 2xl size. For reference I’m 5’7” and 210 lbs and have a very long torso.  3. I got two packs: a medium and large. I'm 5'3'', 135 pounds, and I found them both to fit fine, but the larges are slightly more flattering and comfy. I wear a medium t-shirt but I prefer the larges for this product. Definitely size up if you're on the fence.  4. These are exactly what I was hoping for. I am 5'11"" and wear size 10/12, 36D. I usually go between M and L and I'm happy I got the LARGE in this case. They are long and form fitting but not too tight. The white is pretty see thorough but great for layering.  5. hey're 95% cotton/5% spandex and very comfortable. Very long, too, and cover the booty.

Upright vacuums with high suction power can pull threads from the rug's back and cause ""sprouts."" Use a handheld attachment if possible, or turn off the beater bar as it can pull fibers from the face of the rug and cause the rug to fuzz. If you can't turn it off, set it to the highest position possible. Finally, place the vacuum on the rug carefully.

The queen set comes with 1 flat sheet, 1 fitted sheet and 2 standard pillowcases. They are so soft and high quality. The fitted sheet has elastic all around with deep pockets so it fits the mattress and stays put. They still looked nice right out of the washer and dryer. \r\n\r\nThe set come beautifully packaged. The white box is tied with a pretty ribbon. When you open the box, the set is wrapped with another ribbon. This set would make a beautiful wedding gift. It's excellent quality and makes me feel like I'm at an expensive hotel. \r\n\r\nI'd definitely purchase another set and recommend then to my family and friends."",""title"":""So impressed""},{""name"":""Rob███"",""rating"":5,""review"":""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are great five-star sheets. They are a little 'stiff' out of the box but two trips through the washer (with extra fabric softener) and they were good to go. The cotton is breathable and the fine thread count is especially luxurious. The pockets of the fitted sheet are extra deep and easily accommodate our mattress.

These sheets are amazing. They are super soft and a crisp bright white. The top hems of the flat sheet and pillow cases are a simple double straight stitch.\r\n\r\nThe True Grip feature is an extra wide elastic band on the fitted sheet and it's a game changer. It really helps the sheets stay on the mattress no matter how much tossing and turning you do at night. I won't go back to any sheets with thin and flimsy elastic bands. These sheets are replacing a 400 thread count set and I can really tell the difference in softness between my old 400 count sheets and these 800 count sheets. \r\n\r\nThe set comes in a thick gift box with ribbon and tissue paper, giving it a beautiful presentation.

I let it air out and decompress the full 48 hours recommended by the manufacturer.  I put it on top of my guest room queen bed and left it there.  After that I moved the topper to my bed.  It fits my queen size mattress very well with deep pocket sheets.  My mattress is labeled 14 inches, big it's really 13 inches.  So 13 inches plus 3 inches of memory foam equals 16 inches total.

It is made of good quality  memory foam and has a very nice white zippered cover which is washable.  It has no odor at all, and it decompressed rapidly with no bumps or uneven places.  I let it air out and decompress the full 48 hours recommended by the manufacturer.  I put it on top of my guest room queen bed and left it there.  After that I moved the topper to my bed.  It fits my queen size mattress very well with deep pocket sheets.  My mattress is labeled 14 inches, big it's really 13 inches.  So 13 inches plus 3 inches of memory foam equals 16 inches total. The best part is that the topper has definitely helped relieve my hip pain! An x-ray showed two different problems with my hip, so it wasn't just my firm mattress causing pain.  However, this wonderful topper has reduced the pain by 90-95%!  I consider that pretty amazing! Go ahead and give this topper a try if you're shopping for a memory foam mattress topper.

I got an extra small for my puppy, he is about 3 lb and 7.5 weeks. I don't anticipate him outgrowing it. I wanted it on the smaller side, because I wanted to use it as an alternative to a crate. So glad I chose it!\n\nDurability:\nHe's a small dog so I don't know about large dogs, but the fabric of the mesh and walls are strong, I was surprised. He's more likely to hurt his nails than tear through it. He tried to slam his face into it first night, so I was actually happy it was softer, so it didn't hurt him.\n\nPortability:\nIt's excellent. He can fall asleep in it in the family room and with him still sleeping, I can lift it into the bedroom, so he's there when he wakes up. Not something you can do with a metal crate.\n\nFolding:\nUnfolding was easy. Folding was a challenge. The instructions don't make sense. It took me 45 minutes to figure it out. BUT then I realized the pictures have faint arrows on them in green. I drew over them in dark marker. Following those arrows help a lot.\n\nBetter instructions to go with the pictures:\n\n* As you go through the steps the floor will get bunched up in the folds, push the floor out the bottom so it doesn't get tangled during folding process.\n\n1. Remove mesh top.\n2. Label the panels like a clock with panel 1 being at the top of the photograph and panel 4 being the door.\n3. Locate the hanging band between panels 6"",""title"":""Worth it!

As others have said, the fabric in this product is thinner, but tight knit, and actually more comfortable. They are cool on warm summer days, almost as cool as cotton. The old version has a hem around the leg with congealed, very thin elastic within the hem. The new leg band is turned over without any stitching and only the elastic of the fabric. This is good for those ultra-sensitive to elastic. The hem feels completely smooth, better than the old version. The problem comes at the end of the day. The leg is loose. Because the waist is snug (in a good way) the legs don't ride up, but they aren't stationary. Perhaps a person with wider upper thighs would welcome the extra give.

It's a love affair that began over 35 years ago, and to this day, he continues to sport the same style, model, size, and color with unwavering devotion. These shoes have become more than just footwear; they are a part of his identity, a symbol of reliability, comfort, and enduring style.\n\nThe Reebok Classic Leather shoes are not just your average pair of sneakers; they are vintage-inspired footwear designed to stand the test of time. Crafted with premium leather and adorned with soft suede overlays, they exude a classic yet contemporary charm that never goes out of fashion. The textured look of the materials adds depth and character to the shoes, while also enhancing their durability and longevity.\n\nOne of the standout features of these Reebok shoes is their soft terry lining, which provides a luxurious feel and ensures unparalleled comfort with every step. Whether he's running errands, taking a leisurely stroll, or simply relaxing at home, my dad swears by the unmatched coziness and support offered by his trusty Classic Leather sneakers. They effortlessly adapt to his feet, providing a snug fit that feels like a second skin.\n\nWhat truly sets these shoes apart is their versatility. Unlike other sneakers that are reserved for specific occasions or activities, the Reebok Classic Leather shoes are designed to be worn anywhere and everywhere. From casual outings to more formal events, they seamlessly transition from day to night, making them the ultimate wardrobe staple for my dad.\n\nAnother noteworthy aspect of these shoes is their low-maintenance nature.

Their durable construction and high-quality materials ensure that they only get better with age, developing a unique patina and character that reflects my dad's journey over the years.\n\nIn conclusion, my father's unwavering love for his Reebok Classic Leather shoes is a testament to their exceptional craftsmanship, timeless design, and unmatched comfort.

This was more of a loose fit XL. Washed in cold water and hang dry before use with no shrinking or discoloration or fading on color. Soft cotton. 2. This is a perfect fit and it soft. Not stretchy and doesn't shrink. Don't like things tight so this was a perfect buy. Considering getting more. Totally recommend 3. I love the fit, color, and softness of this shirt. I am 5"" 3' 155lb woman and I ordered a medium for myself and it's perfect. 4. Fit as expected for a 6’1 208lb male. He’s long in torso so the length was just right. Not short like most Large tshirts and it was still roomy. Also, it was soft material not stiff like most cheap tshirts. 5. Being female this Lg. was a bit roomy, im 5’3” and 170.....so it was perfect round the house, errands running shirt, love it, comfy, goid colors....good length. Now cotton will shrink so have to see from there.... 6. Material was a good quality. The only dislike is that the length was just a bit below waist. I’m a 5’-11” and weigh 195 lbs and ordered a Large ,when washed they shrunk a touch so length shorten up a bit. Would recommend a XLarge.

Local Hive Honey is always bottled raw &amp; unfiltered to keep the delicate flavors from the pollen inside intact. This can lead to graininess, discoloration, or crystallized (hardened) honey. All of these are natural and are signs of high-quality honey. If your honey is granulated or crystallized, it has not necessarily spoiled. Place it in 110&ordm; warm water until it reliquifies.

Long story short I received this product thankfully as I was coming to the end of my previous bottle and I have to say I was impressed. The taste is of course honey but there is something extra there left on my palate that was interesting and much more different than other honeys I've tried. This intrigued me and made me do more research on what I was actually consuming and I learned just because it says honey doesn't necessarily mean it's actually honey, and even deeper than that even if it is actually honey taste can vary from region. Not only was I pleased with this product but it also assisted me in educating myself on what I was consuming. I would suggest this product to anyone looking for a healthier sugar alternative and would suggest they do research to see what regions honey works best for them and thankfully this company has a wide variety to start with"",""title"":""Pretty good product""}]",100% US RAW & UNFILTERED HONEY,,,"[{""type"":""Ingredients"",""values"":""100% US RAW & UNFILTERED HONEY""}]","[""Food"",""Pantry"",""New in pantry"",""New in peanut butter and spreads""]"
